=================

Better i-beam (text cursor) for Xcode for dark background / light text color themes.

Directions:

# Clone this repository (or fork it if you want to customize the tiff yourself!)
# Create a backup of `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Resources/DVTIbeamCursor.tiff`
# Copy the tiff to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Resources/DVTIbeamCursor.tiff`
# Restart Xcode

You should now have an i-beam that is more easy to see on a dark or black background.
